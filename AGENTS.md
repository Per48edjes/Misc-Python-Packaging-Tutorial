# Python Packaging Tutorial

This repo houses a toy Python project that does not do anything of substance. Rather, the directory structure
and the files herein are to explore the Python import and module/packaging ecosystem for pedagogical purposes.

Assume you are using this repo to teach intermediate Python programmers about how to structure their projects
to play as nicely and seamlessly with the existing ecosystem as possible. Remember, these programmers have
been writing Python for many years, but want to learn the nuances, "foot-guns," "good-to-knows", best practices
for building and deploying Python code in heterogeneous environments -- both libraries and apps.

**NOTE**: You should always follow good pedagogical practices when generating code or human-readable
files (e.g., comment code, provide reasoning and rationale, etc.). It is not necessary to be verbose
or simplistic (as the programmers involved are generally quite competent), but it is imperative
that idiosyncracies, conventions, and "how" the ecosystem works together be made abundantly clear.
